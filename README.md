Created a simple countdown app using Jetpack Compose! Learning more about te state and animations. 
Shout-out to [Inuwa Ibrahim](https://ibrajix.medium.com/exploring-jetpack-compose-build-a-simple-countdown-timer-app-3151f8000529)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Tried to make the countdown picker as simple as possible by having three text inputs, making it nice for accessibility and usability.
You can also pause the countdown and restart it at any point!
